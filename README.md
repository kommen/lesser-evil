# Lesser Evil

A minimalistic evil-based Emacs configuration that feels like a slimmed down version of Spacemacs.

**This is a personal setup and a work in progress. Things will still change, some things will seem highly opinionated, some things will still break. Use at your own risk. The plan is to eventually evolve this into a @lambdaisland endorsed Clojure-focused evil-based Emacs config, but until we get there this is not intended for general consumption.**

**Initial write-up of the first version is below, but is already outdated.**

While I love Spacemacs I find the sheer size of it can become an issue. It
contains much functionality and many customizations that I don't need, and I
struggle to understand how things fit together, or how to add my own
customizations.

This is an attempt to go back to the basics, a simple and straightforward Emacs
config built from first principles, using `straight.el` for reproducible package
installs, and `use-package` to keep the config tidy. It sets up Vim/Evil style
editing, as well as spacebar-prefixed keybindings in the style of Spacemacs.

I especially felt the need for a lighter config when doing [remote pairing using
tmux](https://lambdaisland.com/blog/2019-12-12-advent-of-parens-12-pairing-cloud-tmux).
The limited set of dependencies should make this config quick to set up, and
snappy in use.

Keybindings based on a `SPC` leader key are installed based on
`leader_bindings.el`. This provides a declarative single source of truth for all
Spacemacs-like bindings.

``` emacs-lisp

  ("S" "Save all" evil-write-all))

 ("s" "Search commands"
  ("s" "Search in buffer" swiper))

 ("h" "Help"
  ("d" "Describe"
   ("k" "Describe key" describe-key)
   ("v" "Describe variable" counsel-describe-variable)
   ("f" "Describe function" counsel-descbinds-function)))

 ("w" "Windows"

  ("/" "Split window right" split-window-right)
  ("-" "Split window below" split-window-below)
